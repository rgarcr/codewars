-- Nathan loves cycling.

-- Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

-- You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded down.

-- For example:

-- hours = 3 ----> liters = 1

-- hours = 6.7---> liters = 3

-- hours = 11.8--> liters = 5
-- Input data is available from the table cycling, which has 2 columns: id and hours. For each row, you have to return 3 columns: id, hours and liters (not litres, it's a difference from the kata description)

//My solution

SELECT id, hours, FLOOR(hours / 2) AS liters FROM cycling
