// You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. Words are always separated by a single space.

// As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

//My solution
function reverse(string) {
    return string.trim().split(" ").reverse().join(" ");
}
