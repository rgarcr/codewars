// Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

// Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

// Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

// Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

// Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.

//My Solution
